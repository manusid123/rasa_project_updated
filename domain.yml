      Innocent Spouse rules, spouse A must be able to prove when signing the returns,
      he or she did not know or have reason to know that at the time filing, the return

      return that has an understatement of tax that's solely attributable to your
      spouse's erroneous item. An erroneous item includes income received by your
      spouse but omitted from the joint return. Deductions, credits, and property
      basis are also erroneous items if they're incorrectly reported on the joint
      return. 2. You establish that at the time you signed the joint return you didn't
      know, and had no reason to know, that there was an understatement of tax and,
      3. Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to
      hold you liable for the understatement of tax.\n To seek innocent spouse relief,

      Relief](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8857.pdf) or a written statement containing
